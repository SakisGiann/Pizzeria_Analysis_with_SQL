Within the scope of my analysis, I set out to answer key questions related to the Pizzeria project.
This comprehensive investigation sheds light on crucial aspects of the business's operations and performance.
Let's delve into the insightful findings addressing the following questions:

Daily Customer Count: By meticulously analyzing the data, I gained a clear understanding of the number of customers visiting the pizzeria each day. This knowledge offers valuable insights into customer flow and helps optimize staffing and resource allocation.

Peak Hours: Through careful examination, I identified specific time frames that witness a surge in customer activity. Understanding peak hours allows for effective operational planning, ensuring exceptional customer service during busy periods.

Average Order Size: I thoroughly explored the order data to uncover patterns and trends related to the number of pizzas typically included in an order. This information provides valuable insights into customer preferences and ordering habits, assisting in streamlining production and inventory management processes.

Bestsellers: By analyzing sales data, I identified the pizzeria's bestselling items. This knowledge enables focused marketing efforts, optimizing promotions for popular choices and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Additionally, my analysis identified a noteworthy insight regarding the worst selling pizza, which indicates a consistently low quantity sold. This information highlights an opportunity for improvement within the pizzeria's menu offerings. By considering the removal of the underperforming pizza from the menu, the business can streamline operations, optimize ingredient inventory, and allocate resources more effectively. This strategic decision aims to enhance profitability and customer satisfaction by focusing on the most popular and successful pizza options.

Annual Revenue: An in-depth evaluation of revenue data throughout the year revealed the financial performance of the pizzeria. This comprehensive assessment provides an accurate snapshot of the business's earnings and overall financial health.

Sales Seasonality: Through rigorous analysis of sales data across different time periods, I identified patterns of seasonality. This understanding helps predict and prepare for fluctuations in demand, allowing for strategic resource allocation and effective sales planning.
